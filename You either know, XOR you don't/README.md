Remember the flag format and how it might help you in this challenge!

## Challenge Description

Given ciphertext (hex):
```
0e0b213f26041e480b26217f27342e175d0e070a3c5b103e2526217f27342e175d0e077e263451150104
```

## Solution Approach

This is a **known-plaintext attack** on a repeating-key XOR cipher.


## Result

```
crypto{1f_y0u_Kn0w_En0uGH_y0u_Kn0w_1t_4ll}
```
